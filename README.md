Here are what I've learned so far watching the cloud computing course

Update on Google Cloud Data Analytics Material

I’ve been progressing through the assigned modules and gaining hands-on familiarity with key Google Cloud tools. So far, I’ve completed lessons on data storage, processing, and visualization, and I’m currently deepening my understanding of how these tools work together in real-world analytics workflows.

 Tools & Concepts Covered:
   1. BigQuery

        A powerful, fully-managed data warehouse for running fast SQL-like queries on large datasets.

        Learned how to write queries, perform joins, aggregations, and work with datasets at scale.

        Particularly useful for analyzing millions of rows with ease and speed.

   2. Looker & Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio)

        Tools for creating interactive, shareable dashboards.

        Got exposure to building data visualizations from BigQuery and integrating multiple data sources.

        Looker Studio is great for visual storytelling and stakeholder-friendly reports.

   3. Cloud Storage & Cloud Functions

        Learned how raw data is ingested and stored in Cloud Storage buckets.

        Also explored basic automation with Cloud Functions to trigger data processing pipelines.

   4. Dataflow & Dataprep

        Introduction to preparing and transforming data for analysis.

        Dataflow allows for streaming/batch data processing using Apache Beam.

        Dataprep (now called Cloud Data Fusion) helps clean messy datasets without heavy coding.

         Real-World Use Cases & Interpretation:

  1. Retail Analytics: BigQuery and Looker can be used by retail companies (like our fictional NaijaMart) to track sales performance, customer segmentation, and inventory trends.

  2. Marketing Insights: Analysts can connect campaign data from platforms like Google Ads to Looker Studio for real-time ROI tracking.

  3.Fraud Detection: Streaming tools like Dataflow help financial institutions flag suspicious transactions in real time.

  4.Healthcare & Public Sector: Government bodies use BigQuery to analyze health trends and respond quickly to public health needs.

The material has helped me see how modern data pipelines are built from ingestion to analysis—and how scalable, cloud-based tools make it easier for teams to collaborate on data projects.
